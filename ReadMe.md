# Web-Scraper
This project is a web-scraping tool that allows you to get data from a website. We are using the scrapy as crawler and might also include Selenium in future for dynamic page scraping.

# Disclaimer
This project by no means try's to get data at the cost of website breakdown. We do not support any user of this tool who try's to do so and the system administrator has all the rights to take an action against the user.

We request every user of this tool to obey the robots.txt rules of all the website and also provide the USER_AGENT info for the system admins so that they can easily reach to you if anything is troubling them.

We also recommend to keep a delay in the request by specifying the DOWNLOAD_DELAY and keep the AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED parameter to True to avoid any overload on the website.
