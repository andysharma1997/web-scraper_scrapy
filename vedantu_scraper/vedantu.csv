                    ,“The course is PHENOMENAL, a must for every kid to master logical thinking. Not just coding, a new kind of personal expression. Ananya, my eight-year-old, is asking questions she’s never asked before. Just yesterday, she broke down all the steps to decide whether to eat a banana by herself on the dinner table after learning algorithms and got a huge kick doing it!”
                    ,“WhiteHat Jr coding course is a truly unique course and kudos to the instructors! Shrey, my 10 year old has developed keen interest in coding after doing the WhiteHat Jr course. His logical thinking is sharper and can now easily relate to structures and algorithms, and wants to create new real-world programs by himself. I wish every kid has exposure to this!”
